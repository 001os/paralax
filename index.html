        <h2>Nature</h2>
        <p>There is no question that Earth has been a giving planet. Everything humans have needed to survive, and
            thrive, was provided by the natural world around us: food, water, medicine, materials for shelter, and even
            natural cycles such as climate and nutrients. Scientists have come to term such gifts ‘ecosystem services’,
            however the recognition of such services goes back thousands of years, and perhaps even farther if one
            accepts the caves paintings at Lascaux as evidence. Yet we have so disconnected ourselves from the natural
            world that it is easy—and often convenient—to forget that nature remains as giving as ever, even as it
            vanishes bit-by-bit. The rise of technology and industry may have distanced us superficially from nature,
            but it has not changed our reliance on the natural world: most of what we use and consume on a daily basis
            remains the product of multitudes of interactions within nature, and many of those interactions are
            imperiled. Beyond such physical goods, the natural world provides less tangible, but just as important,
            gifts in terms of beauty, art, and spirituality.</p>

        <p class="ep">Everything we see around us constitutes nature, including the sun, the moon, trees, flowers,
            fruits, human
            beings, birds, animals, etc. In nature, everyone depends on one another to keep the ecosystem healthy. For
            survival, every creature is interrelated and reliant on one another. Humans, for example, rely on nature for
            their survival, and nature provides us with oxygen, food, water, shelter, medicines, and clothing, among
            other things. Many shades may be seen in nature, contributing to the planet’s beauty. Along with humans,
            animals and birds also find their habitat and means of survival in nature. Therefore, it is essential to
            take proper care of our nature to maintain a healthy life.</p>

        <h2>Look Deep In Nature</h2>
        <p>My Name is <span class="name">Usama</span> I'm 20 Year's old and have always enjoyed spending time outside.
            From going on
            hikes with my family, to climbing the tree in our backyard or even swimming at the beach where my Grampa and
            Nana live. I just like being outside whenever and wherever I can! The one thing I enjoy the most about
            nature though is being surrounded by the forest. There is just something about how the forest surrounds me
            that makes me feel at home, it’s a peaceful and calm place that makes me happy. I like to close my eyes and
            take it all in. You can smell the moss on the trees, hear the sounds of a stream running close by and you
            can feel the forest floor beneath your feet. It’s comforting like a cozy blanket on a cold day. </p>
